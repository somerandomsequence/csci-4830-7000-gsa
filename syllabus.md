#General Information

**Catalog Number:** CSCI 4830/7000

**Time/Place:** Tuesdays & Thursdays 6:30p-7:45p in ECCR 1B08

**Webpage:** http://spatclass.smallwhitecube.com

**Instructor:** Caleb Phillips <caleb.phillips@colorado.edu>

**Office Hours:** By appointment or after class

#Description

This course explores applications of computation to geospatial data---data with geographic context. 
It will introduce concepts of geospatial data organization and processing while utilizing 
a set of standard free, open-source tools including, but not limited to: R, GDAL, GRASS, Proj4,
QGIS, and PostGIS. We will make use of these tools for custom programming tasks in order to take
a flexible and programmatic approach to data analysis. With a foundation of understanding around
geospatial data, we will investigate real-world problems involving large geospatial datasets, and
explore the current research in the area. 

The first half of the course will involve weekly or semi-monthly assignments and readings. Each week
will likely involve one lecture and one seminar. Students are expected to be prepared for discussion
in seminar classes and are responsible for topics covered in lecture.

The second half of the course will focus on individual projects of your choosing. Graduate students
will be expected to take a topic from the current literature and perform a relevant research project.
They are welcome to apply geospatial analysis to their own research, so long as it is on-topic for the
course. Undergraduate students are expected to engineer a solution to a problem of some relevance
which involves geospatial analysis.

#Prerequisites

Although there are no formal pre-requisites for the class, we will be doing some programming in R,
C, and various scripting languages. Some familiarity with basic programming concepts and geometry-level
mathematics are strongly encouraged (unless you want to learn it all on the fly, which you're welcome
to do ;)).

#Computers

??FIXME

You need one! Use the CSEL!

#Assignments

??FIXME

* Collect data in the real world and map it!
* Use GDAL to do stuff like make contours on a plot
* Load shapefiles into a PostGIS database
* Plot stuff on a google map
* Implement a quadtree clustering system
* Carrying capacity?
* Data visualization
* Interpolation

**Data sets:**

??FIXME

* Impermeabile Surfaces
* Weather data (What can we get from NCAR?)
* Falling fruit data
* Hurricane model data (v.s. Bouey data?)

#Skills Lectures

* Introduction
* Coordinates, Projections, Spatial References
* Files - Rasters & Vectors

#Guest Lectures

??FIXME

There will be several guest lectures in the class, particularly near the end.

#Seminar Readings

??FIXME

* TBD

#Grades

Grading will be based upon attendance and participation, quality of execution on assignments, and
final project outcomes. Those students who need a particular grade for their degree should inform
the instructor so that remediation can be investigated if the grade drops below threshold. 

  * Attendance and Participation: 20%
  * Assignments: 30%
  * Final Project: 50%
