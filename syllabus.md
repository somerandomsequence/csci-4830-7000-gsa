#Description

This course explores applications of computation to geospatial data---data with geographic context. 

The course will introduce concepts of geospatial data organization and processing while utilizing 
a set of standard free, open-source tools including, but not limited to: R, GDAL, GRASS, Proj4,
QGIS, and PostGIS. We will make use of these tools for custom programming tasks in order to take
a flexible and programmatic approach to data analysis. With a foundation of understanding around
geospatial data, we will investigate real-world problems involving large geospatial datasets, and
explore the current research in the area. 

The first half of the course will periodic assignments and readings. Each week
will likely involve one lecture and one seminar. Students are expected to be prepared for discussion
in seminar classes and are responsible for topics covered in lecture vis a vis assignments.

The second half of the course will focus on individual projects of your choosing. Graduate students
will be expected to take a topic from the current literature and perform a relevant research project.
They are welcome to apply geospatial analysis to their own research, so long as it is on-topic for the
course. Undergraduate students are expected to engineer a solution to a problem of some relevance and personal interest
which involves geospatial analysis.

#Prerequisites

Although there are no formal pre-requisites for the class, we will be doing some programming in R, Python, potentially
C, and various scripting languages. Some familiarity with basic programming concepts and geometry-level
mathematics are strongly encouraged (unless you want to learn it all on the fly, which you're welcome
to do ;)---caveat emptor).

#Computers

Access to a computer will be required for course assignments and projects. Programmatic tasks will be most approachable on a Unix or Unix-similar computer. The CS department has ample computing resources, particularly in the CSEL, which you are encouraged to make use of. If you are concerned about access to computing resources capable of completing the assignments, please let me know.

#Grades

Grading will be based upon attendance and participation, quality of execution on assignments, and
final project outcomes. A detailed rubric will be developed throughout the course, but a general breakdown is as follows:

  * Attendance: 10%
  * Readings: 20%
  * Assignments: 30%
  * Final Project: 40%
  
Students who need a particular grade for their degree requirements are encouraged to inform the instructor so that extra-credit assignments might be assessed to bring a grade above threshold. There is absolutely no reason to get a grade below the one you desire. Note that that extra-credit work may be fairly complex or laborious as compared to the required course work. Because of that, I don't advise relying on extra-credit work to bolster your grade, unless needed, or you're simply interested in doing additional work. Students who are auditing the course are similarly encourage to discuss goals with the instructor.

Additional notes: 

  * In many cases grading will be done immediately at a deadline. Late work will not be graded. Missed/late work can be compensated for by doing extra credit assignments. 
  * The attendance grade is not a participation grade. If you feel like being quiet (some days or every day), you will not be penalized for it. You are expected, however, to show up, ideally on time, and be present and listening.

#Policies

**Academic Integrity**

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and at http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/.

**Classroom Behavior**

Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html and at http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code

**Disability**

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to me a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner so that your needs be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact: 303-492-8671, Willard 322, and http://www.Colorado.EDU/disabilityservices

**Discrimination and Harassment**

The University of Colorado at Boulder policy on Discrimination and Harassment, the University of Colorado policy on Sexual Harassment and the University of Colorado policy on Amorous Relationships apply to all students, staff and faculty. Any student, staff or faculty member who believes s/he has been the subject of discrimination or harassment based upon race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status should contact the Office of Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Judicial Affairs at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH, the above referenced policies and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be obtained at http://www.colorado.edu/odh

**Religious Observance**

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance.
