#Description

This course explores applications of computation to geospatial data---data with geographic context. 

The course will introduce concepts of geospatial data organization and processing while utilizing 
a set of standard free, open-source tools including, but not limited to: R, GDAL, GRASS, Proj4,
QGIS, and PostGIS. We will make use of these tools for custom programming tasks in order to take
a flexible and programmatic approach to data analysis. With a foundation of understanding around
geospatial data, we will investigate real-world problems involving large geospatial datasets, and
explore the current research in the area. 

The first half of the course will periodic assignments and readings. Each week
will likely involve one lecture and one seminar. Students are expected to be prepared for discussion
in seminar classes and are responsible for topics covered in lecture vis a vis assignments.

The second half of the course will focus on individual projects of your choosing. Graduate students
will be expected to take a topic from the current literature and perform a relevant research project.
They are welcome to apply geospatial analysis to their own research, so long as it is on-topic for the
course. Undergraduate students are expected to engineer a solution to a problem of some relevance and personal interest
which involves geospatial analysis.

#Prerequisites

Although there are no formal pre-requisites for the class, we will be doing some programming in R, Python, potentially
C, and various scripting languages. Some familiarity with basic programming concepts and geometry-level
mathematics are strongly encouraged (unless you want to learn it all on the fly, which you're welcome
to do ;)---caveat emptor).

#Computers

Access to a computer will be required for course assignments and projects. Programmatic tasks will be most approachable on a Unix or Unix-similar computer. The CS department has ample computing resources, particularly in the CSEL, which you are encouraged to make use of. If you are concerned about access to computing resources capable of completing the assignments, please let me know.


#Grades

Grading will be based upon attendance and participation, quality of execution on assignments, and
final project outcomes. A detailed rubric will be developed throughout the course, but a general breakdown is as follows:

  * Attendance: 20%
  * Assignments: 30%
  * Final Project: 50%
  
Students who need a particular grade for their degree requirements are encouraged to inform the instructor so that extra-credit assignments might be assessed to bring a grade above threshold. Be aware that extra-credit work may be very complex or laborious :). Students who are auditing the course are similarly encourage to discuss goals with the instructor.
