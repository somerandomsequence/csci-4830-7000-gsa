The second half of the course will give you the opportunity to seek out a project
of your choosing and investigate it with some thoroughness.

The guidelines for the project selection are fairly open: it must involve some geospatial
data analysis, and it must be of a reasonable size and shape for the class.

**Undergraduate students** are expected to select a problem demonstrating some ambition and requiring a reasonable amount of problem solving and engineering. Undergraduate students should be aware of some relevant, related research in the area.

**Graduate students** are expected to do work of some novelty and importance, ideally with some potential for publishing. Those students with their own research (and theses) are encouraged to select something that overlaps with their existing area of expertise. Graduate students are expected to survey the literature to a sufficient extent that they can describe exactly how the question they've investigated advances the state of the art, or complements existing methods.

There are some important events and deliverables:

  * **Proposal** - You'll tell the class what you want to do and solicit feedback
  * **Abstract** - 1 page abstract describing project aims will be due at the start
  * **Status** - You'll check in with the class and give an update on your project several times
  * **Talk/Paper** - Final results will be presented as a short talk and final paper in technical conference format
