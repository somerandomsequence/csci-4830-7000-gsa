The second half of the course will give you the opportunity to seek out a project
of your choosing and investigate it with some thoroughness.

The guidelines for the project selection are fairly open: it must involve some geospatial
data analysis, and it must be of a reasonable size and shape for the class.

**Undergraduate students** are expected to select a problem demonstrating some ambition and requiring a reasonable amount of problem solving and engineering. Undergraduate students should be aware of some relevant, related research in the area.

**Graduate students** are expected to do work of some novelty and importance, ideally with potential for publishing. Those students with their own research (and theses) are encouraged to select something that overlaps with their existing area of expertise if thats desirable. Graduate students are expected to survey the literature to a sufficient extent that they can describe how the question they've investigated advances the state of the art, or complements existing methods.

In both cases students are welcome to extend current projects from their own research, open sourcery, or other classes with geospatial analysis (so long as the geospatial addition constitutes meaningful work and makes sense for the project).

There are some important events and deliverables:

  * **Proposal** - You'll tell the class what you want to do and solicit feedback
  * **Abstract** - 1 page abstract (no longer) describing project aims will be due at the start. This should be in LaTeX format with references as necessary.
  * **Status** - You'll check in with the class and give a short, detailed update on your project several times. Come prepared with visuals and demos.
  * **Talk/Paper** - Final results will be presented as a short talk and final paper in the format of a technical conference paper of approximately 8-12 pages, single spaced, two-column with figures and references included.
  
## Inspiration

Not sure what you want to do? As you think about a project you may find [this giant list of free GIS data](http://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/) helpful. The newspaper can provide some inspiration vis a vis interesting current social analysis, and the website [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) sometimes has inspiring data examples (although you have to avoid all the sportsball references). As a last resort I'm happy to offer some project ideas, although it's most helpful if you come to the discussion with a couple directions in mind.

## Pace and General Expectations

Status reports are intended to keep your pace of work and progress even throughout the 6-8 weeks of project development. You're encouraged to make progress on your project each week and budget your time to allow that. 

If you feel you are having problems with your project or may not be able to complete the goals you set out for, it is your responsibility to set up a time to communicate those concerns to me. Since the project is a large chunk of the grade, it's preferable to consider approaches to pivoting or remediation early on.
